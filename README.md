# Movable Type Bootstrap Theme

The purpose here is twofold: 

* Facilitate the rapid development of themes starting from [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), the framework created by Twitter. No longer start from scratch when you need to create a new theme. Simply Fork this GitHub repository and start work with a ready-made skeleton. 
* Explain how simple it is to create, manage, and deploy a custom theme in Movable Type and Melody.

**This is not a functioning theme**, but a skeleton for creating a Movable Type or Melody theme. The included `config.yaml` is not only a boilerplate for creating a brand new theme, but also includes examples of what is possible with [ConfigAssistant](https://github.com/endevver/mt-plugin-configassistant) and [Theme Manager](https://github.com/endevver/mt-plugin-theme-manager).

This package includes a version for MT4/Melody and for MT5. The MT5 version has no prerequisites beyond the most current release of MT5.

## Movable Type 4 Prerequisites

* Movable Type 4.1 or higher
* [Config Assistant](http://github.com/endevver/mt-plugin-configassistant)
* [Theme Manager](https://github.com/endevver/mt-plugin-theme-manager)

## Melody Prerequisites

* Melody 1.0 or higher [Download](https://github.com/openmelody/melody)
* ConfigAssistant and Theme Manager are both bundled with Melody


# Theme Template Usage

This section will explain what to modify before you get started building out your theme using this skeleton. Please keep in mind that this is not a completed theme you can install and use, but a boilerplate for creating your own theme.

* Will add this later
